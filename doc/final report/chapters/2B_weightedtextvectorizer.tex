The weighted text vectorizer is an extension of the textvectorizer that takes into account the links of the proposed documents. The vectors of the links of a document are added with some weight to the vectors of the documents themselves. Intuitively, this would add semantic information about a document based on it's links. For example, a Person is likely to write other documents about his or her subjects of expertise. Knowing not only the biography of a Person, but also the content he or she has added to StarFish, gives a more complete image of what documents could be related to that Person.

The vectors of links of a document are added in a recursive way, where documents that are linked directly have a higher weight than documents that are linked transitively. The algorithm is displayed in figure xx.

The weighted text vectorizer performs better than the normal text vectorizer. % LOOK FOR AN EXAMPLE THAT SHOWS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
