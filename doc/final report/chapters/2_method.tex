\section{Method}
\subsection{Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item How big is the dataset
\item Types of documents
\item Properties of documents (title, author ect)
\item Tags: meaning, aliases and glossaries
\item Linking between documents: probabilities \& standard linking of authors
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Text vectorization}
\subsubsection{Textvectorizer}
\input{chapters/2A_textvectorizer}

\subsubsection{Weighted textvectorizer}
\input{chapters/2B_weightedtextvectorizer}

\subsection{Tag vectorization}
\subsubsection{Simple tag vectorizer}
\input{chapters/2C_simpletagvectorizer}

\subsubsection{Tag smoothing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation: use connection between tags
\item Implementation: based on the paper
\item Evaluation: very slow, similar results as the simple tag vectorizer, 'magic' so cannot really see why something happens
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Glossaries of tags}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation: find underlying network between tags by using their glossaries
\item Implementation: hybrid form of text and tag vectorizer
\item Evaluation: does not work well (find out why!) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distance metrics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Eucledian
\item Cosine
\item Bhattacharyya
\item Correlation
\item Intersection
\end{itemize}
