The tag smoothing vectorizers creates descriptors based on the tag set of a document. A tag co-occurs with other tags in a document, we assume documents with similar tags should be linked in Starfish. Let the frequency of occurrence with other tags across the dataset form a vector for each tag. The descriptor for a document is then created by combining the occurrence vectors for all the document's tags. Now documents with tags that occur together will be seen as similar.

There are two reasons why one would like to smooth the tag co-occurences. Firstly, a problem for this is that tags must occur together before the algorithms works properly. The starfish dataset contains a lot of tags that only occur with a small frequency, which means the tag occurrence vector will contain many zeros. This makes the algorithm perform bad with little data. Secondly, two tags can describe the same concept and be connected to that concept through a common co-occurence with another tag. Whilst they describe the same concept and are connected to that, they are not directly linked together. Therefore it seems feasible to perform some sort of smoothing on the co-occurences of tags.

\citet{zhou2011web} proposed a method to cluster web documents based on tag set similarity. This is based on a similarity between two tags as a relation between the frequency these tags occur separate and together, as described in equation~\ref{eq:tag_similarity}. To smooth these similarities between tags, a tag similarity matrix $\mathcal{C}$ is constructed. Each entry $c_{i,j}$ in this matrix can be viewed as the angle $\theta_{i,j}$ between two unknown vectors $v_i$ and $v_j$. These vectors cover both explicit similarity and implicit similarity \citep{park2010vector}. This transfers the problem to find a set of linearly independent vectors $\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\}$ for which for all $v_i \cdot v_j = \cos(\theta_{i,j})$. One must find a matrix $\mathcal{V}$ for which $V^TV = C$. This can be done by orthogonal triangularization on $\mathcal{C}$ for which \citeauthor{zhou2011web} introduces a modified Cholesky transform.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tag_similarity}
s_{i,j} = \frac{f_{i,j}}{f_i + f_j - f_{i,j}}
\end{equation}

Each row in new matrix $\mathcal{T}$ can now be used as a vector describing a tag. A document descriptor can now be created by summing all of the row vectors in  $\mathcal{T}$ for all tags in a document.
