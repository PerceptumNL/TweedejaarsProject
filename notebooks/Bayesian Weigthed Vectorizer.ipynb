      "Above all the parts we need to compute $P(d_i \\to d_j \\mid t)$ are given. We will now specify these more exact and explain how these probabilities will we used to compute a document similarity metric. Using bayes rule we can rewrite this to:\n",

      "$$P(t) = \\frac{|D_t| \\choose 2}{|D| \\choose 2} = \\frac{|D_t|\\cdot(|D_t| - 1)}{|D| \\cdot (|D| - 1)}$$\n",

      "Next we need to compute $P(d_i \\to d_j)$. This is the probability that a document with type of $d_I$ ($\\text{type}(d_i)$) is linked to a document of $\\text{type}(d_j)$. This will result in a matrix of probabilities where for each type combination (order does matter) a probability is computed. Below we compute these for the data export of june 12th. For some types there are no links to some other types. We do not want to assign a probability of zero so we use laplace smoothing to assign the probabilities. The table below displays the type-link probability of two document. The probabilities are displayed from a document of a type in the left most row to a document in a column."
