      "Today we have worked further on the sprints. Jorn and Lotte worked on finalizing the scaffold, which now takes one of the vectorizers (= algorithm), combines it with some distance measure (e.g. cosine or eucledian distance) and generates all recommended links for all files in the dataset. The results are shown in an HTML page. We are keeping some better visualizations in mind (e.g. d3) but this works well enough for now. Robbert finished with his implementation of the weighted tags algorithm and also rewrote that one in the proper form. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also had a short meeting with our clients, in which we showed our first results. From this we have a better understanding what links between documents are correct and which are not. We also found out that our code has a few bugs, which means that one of the algorithms (that seemed to perform the best) did a totally different thing than we intended. Most of these bugs were fixed on the spot. We will analyze the results of the algorithms even further tomorrow. Additionally, we will put some work in defining a threshold for the number of recommended documents that are returned, a subject that was also discussed during the meeting with the client."

      "Despite the holidays we came together at the office today. First we had a stand up meeting where we discussed what we have done since our last meeting on Friday. Then we had a small meeting with our clients, where we discussed our plans for this week. We discussed the evaluation metrics and came up with some good implementable ideas. Sander asked us to make sure to have some viewable results within a few days so that we can qualitatively see how each algorithm is working. Additionally, we are going to set up an appointment with Natasa Brouwer for the expert-evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the meeting we have worked on the other sprint items. Lotte has finished the document text and weighted document text algorithm, and Robbert has been working on the weighted tags algorithm. Jorn has implemented Nearest Neighbour and has made a scaffold for the program flow of our first deliverable. However, combining the algorithms and the main program flow still requires some work, which means that we cannot fully tests the algorithms yet. Therefore, none of the sprint items can yet be annotated as done. "

      "### Planning presentations\n",
      "This morning we met at 9:30 to make the last preparations for our presentation. We also prepared some questions for our meeting with our academic mentor Raquel Fernandez. From 10:30-12:30 we attended the planning presentations and also presented our own planning. The Scrum Trainer was very positive about our planning, which gives us the feeling that we are on the right track - at least from a Scrum perspective. \n",

      "### Meeting with academic mentor\n",
      "After the presentations we had a meeting with Raquel Fernandez, which Robrecht Jurriaans (Product Owner) also attended. We discussed our current plans from an academic point of view and brainstormed about some algorithms that might be useful for the problem at hand. Raquel agreed that the current approach of using descriptors and some comparing algorithm (such as NN) is the right way to go. Therefore, we could finalize the planning for our first sprint, leaving everything as we had planned. From this meeting we also concluded that the evaluation of the algorithms continues to be a tricky problem to tackle and we will surely be brainstorming about that next week, both with in the team as with our clients. We plan to have another meeting with Raquel next Thursday. \n",

      "### Working on the first stories \n",

Robbert worked on some research for the graph-based tag descriptor (story 5), Jorn set up a basic framework for the classes that the algorithms will be described in (part of story 3) and Lotte worked on the text-based tag descriptor (story 4). Monday we will really start with very first real sprint. \n"

      "### Scrum Workshop and Backlog\n",
      "The day started with a scrum workshop hosted by Silverline. During this workshop we learned how to use scrum for software projects. During this workshop it became clear that it is hard for us to completely implement scrum during the project. First because we only have a small team so a real scrum master would be a bit overdone. Secondly because currently we don't completely know how to solve that problem given by the client. This means we first have to do research on the problem. Currently we are working on a first sollution that was proposed by the client. But after finishing this we will work on improving the results step by step. With this in mind we sat down with our client today to define the first items in our backlog. We defined multiple sollutions that we have have come up with as items on the backlog. Also the implementation of the scaffold software and defenition and implementation of the evaluation metric are on the backlog. For now we will try to stick to the sprint, but if we find out that these are still to limited for us to achieve something we will switch to a more kanban like process [1] as was recommended during the workshop.\n",
