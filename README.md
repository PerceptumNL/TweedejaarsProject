The document linker can be called using documentlinker.py
Calling documentlinker.py will explain all the needed parameters.
For an explanation of all the parameters we refer to the report.

- datawrapper.py 		contains the class that keeps track of the data and data preprocessing steps
- distance.py 			contains the implementations of all distance metrics
- documentlinker.py 		contains the program flow of linking documents
- prob.py 				contains the code for calculating the tag and link probabilities

- the directory preprocessing contains the steps needed for removing HTML from the document content
- the directory vectorizers contains the implementations of each of the vectorizers. We refer to the
report for a thorough explanation of what they do and how they perform.
